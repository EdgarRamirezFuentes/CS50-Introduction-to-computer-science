This repository storages the activities and code that I am doing on the course CS50 Introduction to Computer Science by [HarvardX](https://vpal.harvard.edu/HarvardX) on [edX](https://www.edx.org/es).  
I believe knowledge should be shared and we’re all better if we can learn from one another. For that reason:

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

You can use the slides to study about programming and learn new things about programming. 💻

The code in here was created by me, and you can use it to compare your own solution with my solution. For any circumstances you should use my code to submit on the course platform. 🛑

I wish this material is useful for you, and never stop learning! 📖
